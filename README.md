## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript & Json (api)

### What I learned

For this project, i had to learn more about positioning, specially relative position.
i'm also quite happy about that :hover, easy to apply with a lot of potential.
Obviously, i learned how to use API ( CRUD, JSON, ...). it was more difficult to understand arrow function dealing with promises && .then.
I found myself stuck for a while, my code didn't seem to work at first. I figured out that i had to place my function after my HTML section to let the browser load the page entirely before accessing and calling the API.

### Continued development

I surely need to work again with APIs and arrow functions. Also use more :hover property with my css. that's a lot of fun.
My css is far from optimal and needs to be apply with Sass maybe.

### Useful resources

to learn and apply API calls i used some of the ressources down below:

- [OpenClassrooms (french courses)](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/6573181-adoptez-les-api-rest-pour-vos-projets-web) - This helped me for API section. This course is well organized et quite easy to understand.
- [Mike Codeur](https://formations.mikecodeur.com/view/courses/api-pro/69245-appel-des-api-restful/197955-module-9-crud-api-en-javascript) - This guy is far from academic, but displays such great advices && allows us to pratice along him with concrete examples.
- [Useful tools](https://kigiri.github.io/fetch/)(https://curlconverter.com) - to anyone who read this, be free to take a look at those websites. Can be very useful when you work with curl commands
